### The History and Growth of Data

#### Slide: Throughout Most of Human History

**Slide Number:** 3

**Slide Text:**
Throughout
Most of
Human
History
Data difficult to collect and store

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
The right side of the slide shows a large, weathered stone tablet covered in dense cuneiform script. The text on the left is set against a black background, emphasizing the message that for most of history, data was a physical, cumbersome thing.

**Slide Topics:**
*   History of Data
*   Data Collection
*   Data Storage
*   Pre-digital Era

**Slide Narration:**
"To understand where we are now, we need to look back. For the vast majority of human history, data was incredibly difficult to collect and even harder to store. Think about it—records were kept on stone tablets like this one, on papyrus, or in handwritten ledgers. Each data point was a significant physical effort to create and preserve. This inherent difficulty placed a severe limit on the amount of information societies could accumulate and analyze."

#### Slide: Galileo's Hand-drawn Sunspots

**Slide Number:** 4

**Slide Text:**
Galileo's Hand-drawn Sunspots

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
The slide displays four circular diagrams, which are reproductions of Galileo's astronomical observations. Each circle represents the sun, with small, dark markings indicating the positions of sunspots on different days (labeled "Giu: D. 2", "Giu: D. 3.", "Ging: D. 5.", "Ging: D. 6"). The drawings are on aged, parchment-like paper.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Historical Data
*   Observational Data
*   Astronomy
*   Galileo Galilei
*   Manual Data Recording

**Slide Narration:**
"Here is a fantastic example of historical data collection: Galileo's hand-drawn sketches of sunspots from the early 17th century. To track the movement of these spots, he had to observe them through a telescope and meticulously draw what he saw, day after day. This was a painstaking, manual process. This represents the state-of-the-art for data collection at the time—it was manual, slow, and generated a very small amount of data by today's standards."

*   Solar Observation
*   NASA
*   SOHO / SDO

**Slide Narration:**
"Instead of hand drawings, we now have instruments like the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Solar Dynamics Observatory capturing Ultra HD video of the sun, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We have ground-based observatories like the Wilcox Solar Observatory also constantly monitoring it. The amount of data generated by these instruments in a single day dwarfs what Galileo could have collected in his entire lifetime. This is the fundamental shift we're going to be talking about."

#### Slide: Is Data Science a new thing?

**Slide Number:** 10

**Slide Text:**
Is Data Science a new thing?
If things can combine to make something new

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
A simple text slide with a black background. The text is white.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Definition of Data Science
*   Interdisciplinary Fields
*   Synergy

**Slide Narration:**
"So, this brings us back to our original question. Is Data Science really a 'new' thing? Or is it just a rebranding of old ideas? The argument I'll make is that while its components are not new, their combination is. When you combine the massive availability of data with the massive availability of computation, new capabilities emerge that simply weren't possible before. It's this synergy that creates the new field of data science."

#### Slide: What is data science?

**Slide Number:** 11

**Slide Text:**
What is data science?
Hacking Skills
Math & Statistics Knowledge
Machine Learning
Danger Zone!
Data Science
Traditional Research
Substantive Expertise

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
This slide displays the classic Drew Conway Data Science Venn Diagram. There are three main overlapping circles:
1.  **Red Circle (Top Left):** "Hacking Skills"
2.  **Green Circle (Top Right):** "Math & Statistics Knowledge"
3.  **Blue Circle (Bottom):** "Substantive Expertise"
The intersections are labeled:
*   `Hacking Skills + Math/Stats = Machine Learning`
*   `Math/Stats + Substantive Expertise = Traditional Research`
*   `Hacking Skills + Substantive Expertise = Danger Zone!` (where one has skills but lacks statistical rigor)
*   The central intersection of all three is labeled "**Data Science**".

**Slide Topics:**
*   Data Science Venn Diagram
*   Core Competencies
*   Hacking Skills
*   Statistics
*   Domain Knowledge
*   Machine Learning

**Slide Narration:**
"This Venn diagram is one of the most famous and useful definitions of data science. It posits that data science is the intersection of three key skill sets. First, you need 'Math and Statistics Knowledge' to ensure your conclusions are rigorous and sound. Second, you need 'Hacking Skills,' which doesn't mean breaking into systems, but rather the ability to work with data computationally—programming, scripting, and using tools to handle messy, large-scale data. Third, and critically, you need 'Substantive Expertise'—domain knowledge about the subject you're studying. You can't analyze genomic data without knowing biology, or financial data without understanding markets. Where these three areas overlap, that's where true data science happens. If you have programming skills and domain knowledge but lack statistical rigor, you're in the 'Danger Zone,' where you can easily misinterpret your findings."

The slide shows three components connected by plus signs.
1.  **Algorithms:** A diagram of a simple neural network identifying different objects (lines, faces, cats).
2.  **Computation:** A photo of server racks in a data center.
3.  **Visualization:** A word cloud generated from tweets, with words like "book," "people," "publishing," and "data" being prominent.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Data Science Workflow
*   Algorithms
*   Computation
*   Data Visualization

**Slide Narration:**
"So, how do we actually cope with this flood of data? We can think of the process as having three key pillars. We need sophisticated **Algorithms**, like the machine learning models shown here, to find patterns in the data. We need massive **Computation** infrastructure to run these algorithms on our huge datasets. And finally, we need **Visualization** to interpret the results and communicate our findings. Without visualization, the output of our complex models is often just a meaningless pile of numbers."

#### Slide: Machine Learning

**Slide Number:** 14

**Slide Text:**
Machine Learning
KMeans
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Clustering Problem
Classification Problem
Regression Problem
Goal: Explore structure of data and make predictions

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
The slide shows three plots, each illustrating a fundamental type of machine learning problem.
1.  **Clustering Problem:** A scatter plot labeled "KMeans" shows data points grouped into four distinct, color-coded clusters.
2.  **Classification Problem:** A plot labeled "Linear Discriminant Analysis" shows two classes of data points (red and blue) separated by a black line. The background is shaded to show the decision regions.
3.  **Regression Problem:** A scatter plot shows data points scattered around a blue line that represents the best fit, aiming to predict a continuous value.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Machine Learning
*   Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
*   Classification (Supervised Learning)
*   Regression (Supervised Learning)
*   Predictive Modeling

**Slide Narration:**
"A huge part of data science is Machine Learning. The overall goal here is to explore the structure of our data and use that structure to make predictions. We'll look at three main types of problems. First, **Clustering**, an unsupervised problem where we ask the algorithm to find natural groupings in the data without any pre-defined labels. Second, **Classification**, where the goal is to predict a category, like whether an email is spam or not spam. And third, **Regression**, where we aim to predict a continuous value, like the price of a house or future temperature."

#### Slide: Information Understanding

**Slide Number:** 17

**Slide Text:**
Information
Understanding

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
A diagram showing two blue boxes with arrows pointing from them to an anatomical drawing of the human brain. The top box says "Information" and the bottom box says "Understanding." The visual metaphor is that the brain processes raw information to create genuine understanding.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Cognition
*   Data Interpretation
*   Insight
*   Purpose of Visualization

**Slide Narration:**
"The ultimate goal of any data analysis is to move from raw **Information**—that is, tables of numbers, logs, and records—to genuine **Understanding** and insight. Visualization is arguably the most powerful tool we have for making this leap. It leverages the power of our own visual cortex, the most advanced pattern-recognition machine known, to help us see the stories hidden within the data."

#### Slide: Data Visualization Global Temp

**Slide Number:** 18

**Slide Text:**
Data Visualization Global Temp
Year Annual_Mean 5-year_Mean
[Table of data from 1880 to 2014]

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
The slide is filled with a large table of numerical data. The columns are "Year," "Annual_Mean," and "5-year_Mean." The data represents global temperature anomalies. It's difficult to quickly discern any trend or pattern just by looking at the numbers.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Raw Data
*   Tabular Data
*   Global Temperature
*   Limits of Raw Data

**Slide Narration:**
"Let's look at a concrete example. Here is raw data for global temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2014. It's just a table of numbers. I could ask you to find the warmest year or to describe the overall trend, but it would take you a while to scan through this and you might not be very confident in your answer. This is raw information, and in this format, it's not very useful."

#### Slide: Global Means Temp as Graph

**Slide Number:** 19

**Slide Text:**
Global Means Temp as Graph
Hansen et al. (2006), NASA GISS

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
This slide presents the same data from the previous slide, but now as a line graph titled "Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index." The x-axis is the year (1880-2000+) and the y-axis is the Temperature Anomaly in degrees Celsius. There are two lines: a black line with squares for the "Annual Mean" and a smoother red line for the "5-year Running Mean." The graph clearly and immediately shows a strong upward trend in temperature, especially in recent decades.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Line Graphs
*   Time Series Analysis
*   Climate Change
*   Power of Visualization

**Slide Narration:**
"But now, look what happens when we visualize that exact same data. This graph plots the annual mean temperature and a five-year running mean over time. The pattern is now unmistakable. You can instantly see the long-term warming trend. No one looking at this graph could fail to see what's happening. We've moved from a confusing table of information to clear understanding, all thanks to a simple visualization."

#### Slide: Viz Critical for Data Exploration

**Slide Number:** 20

**Slide Text:**
Viz Critical for Data Exploration
hg19 chr7:27053398-27373766
One pixel spans 400 bp

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
A complex screenshot from the UCSC Genome Browser. It shows multiple tracks of genomic data for a specific region of human chromosome 7. Each track is a histogram-like plot representing different biochemical signals (e.g., H3K4me3, H3K27me3) along the DNA sequence. Below are tracks for gene annotations (like HOXA genes). This type of visualization is essential for biologists to explore relationships between different genomic features.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Data Exploration
*   Genomics
*   Complex Datasets
*   Scientific Visualization

**Slide Narration:**
"And this isn't just for simple time-series data. For truly complex, high-dimensional data, visualization is absolutely critical for exploration and discovery. This is a view from a genome browser. Each of these tracks represents a different type of data about a segment of our DNA. Without a visual interface like this, it would be impossible for a scientist to make sense of these millions of data points and see how different genes and regulatory elements are related. Visualization is not just for presentation; it's a core tool for the analysis itself."

#### Slide: Statistics

**Slide Number:** 21

**Slide Text:**
Statistics
Global Average Temperature Vs. Number of Pirates
venganza.org

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
A humorous graph plotting two variables over time from 1820 to 2000. The x-axis is the "Number of Pirates (Approximate)" (decreasing from ~35,000 to 17), and the y-axis is the "Global Average Temperature (C)" (increasing from ~14 to ~16). The line shows a strong negative correlation: as the number of pirates decreased, the global temperature increased. The background has a faint image of a skull and crossbones.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Correlation vs. Causation
*   Spurious Correlations
*   Statistical Literacy
*   Critical Thinking

**Slide Narration:**
"This brings us to statistics. While we're finding patterns, we need to be careful. This is a famous graph that shows a nearly perfect correlation between the decline in the number of pirates and the rise in global average temperatures. So, does this mean that the lack of pirates is causing global warming? Of course not. This is a classic example of a spurious correlation, and it's a humorous but important reminder of the most famous lesson in statistics..."

#### Slide: Statistics: Nonsense Protection

**Slide Number:** 22

**Slide Text:**
Statistics: Nonsense Protection
Panel 1: "I USED TO THINK CORRELATION IMPLIED CAUSATION."
Panel 2: "THEN I TOOK A STATISTICS CLASS. NOW I DON'T."
Panel 3: "SOUNDS LIKE THE CLASS HELPED." "WELL, MAYBE."

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
A three-panel comic strip from the webcomic xkcd. Two stick figures are talking. In the first panel, one admits to believing correlation implied causation. In the second, they say a statistics class changed their mind. In the third, when the other character suggests the class was the cause of the change, the first character cheekily replies, "Well, maybe," humorously applying their newfound skepticism about causation.

**Slide Topics:**
*   Correlation vs. Causation
*   Logical Fallacies
*   Scientific Skepticism
*   Role of Statistics

**Slide Narration:**
"...which is that correlation does not imply causation. Statistics is our 'nonsense protection.' It gives us the tools to rigorously test our hypotheses and to understand the difference between a real relationship and a random coincidence. As this comic hilariously points out, learning statistics makes you more skeptical, and that skepticism is a crucial attribute for any good data scientist."

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
A system architecture diagram showing modern big data "design patterns." Data flows from sources (represented by database icons) through `kafka` (a streaming platform) into `Spark` (a processing engine). From Spark, data can be sent to `jupyter` notebooks for analysis, `elastic` for search, or stored in `cassandra` (a NoSQL database). The entire stack is shown running on `MESOS` and `docker` for containerization, all hosted on "some cloud."

**Slide Topics:**
*   Big Data Architecture
*   Data Engineering
*   Distributed Systems
*   Spark, Kafka, Docker

**Slide Narration:**
"Finally, how do we handle data at the massive scale we discussed? This requires a field known as Data Engineering, which focuses on building the infrastructure and pipelines to move and process large datasets. This diagram shows a typical modern big data stack. You have tools like Kafka for ingesting real-time data streams, Spark for large-scale distributed processing, and various databases like Cassandra for storage. These systems are incredibly complex and are the bedrock upon which data science at scale is built."

**Slide Narration:**
"The process of data engineering can be broken down into several key steps. First is sourcing the data, which can come from anywhere. Then comes the often difficult and time-consuming process of data cleaning—handling missing values, errors, and inconsistencies, as described in the 'Bad Data Handbook.' Finally, the clean data needs to be transformed, or 'wrangled,' into a format suitable for analysis. This entire pipeline—from raw, messy source to clean, structured dataset—is the work of data engineering, and it's absolutely essential for any successful data science project."

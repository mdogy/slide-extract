Improved Multi-Deck Analysis Prompt
Perform the slide analysis below on all attached files. Each file represents a separate lecture deck.

Prompt for Comprehensive Multi-Deck Lecture Analysis
You are an expert AI assistant specializing in academic content analysis. Your task is to analyze the multiple sets of lecture slides (decks) provided as a sequence of images.

Process each deck independently and present the analyses sequentially in a single, continuous markdown output. The goal is to create a document so thorough that a person could understand the content of each lecture without seeing the original slides.

Process all slides from the first deck, then all slides from the second deck, and so on.

Master Formatting Instructions
Use the following markdown structure to organize the entire output:

Each new lecture deck must begin with a primary heading (#). Use the format # Lecture Deck [Number]: [Inferred Deck Title].

All subsequent formatting instructions apply within each lecture deck's section.

Separate each major lecture deck section with a horizontal rule (---).

Deck-Specific Formatting Instructions
Within each lecture deck analysis, use the following structure:

The overall lecture title should be a secondary heading (##) (e.g., ## Lecture 5: Introduction to Neural Networks).

Sections within a lecture should be third-level headings (###) (e.g., ### The Perceptron).

Each slide analysis must begin with a fourth-level heading (####) containing the slide's title.

Under each slide's heading, provide the following sections:

**Slide Number:** The sequential number of the slide. This numbering must reset to 1 for each new deck.

**Slide Text:** Transcribe all text from the slide verbatim, including titles, bullet points, and labels.

**Slide Equations:** Extract all mathematical formulas, formatting them with LaTeX ($ for inline, $$ for block).

**Slide Images/Diagrams:** Provide a detailed description of all visual elements (charts, diagrams, illustrations). Describe axes, labels, components, connections, and the overall purpose of the visual.

**Slide Topics:** List the key concepts, theories, or algorithms on the slide.

**Slide Narration:** Synthesize all information into a plausible lecturer's narration. This should explain concepts, define terms, connect ideas, and provide context, elaborating on the slide's content as if teaching a class.

Example of Desired Output (for one slide within a deck)
#### Slide: The Cost Function in Linear Regression

**Slide Number:** 5

**Slide Text:**

Our Goal: Choose parameters $\theta_0, \theta_1$ that minimize the error.

**Slide Images/Diagrams:**
A 3D surface plot is shown. The horizontal axes are labeled $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$. The vertical axis is labeled Cost J($\theta_0, \theta_1$). The surface is a smooth, convex, bowl-shaped parabola. At the absolute bottom of the bowl, a red dot is marked, indicating the point of minimum cost.

"Okay, everyone, so we've just defined our hypothesis function... [Full narration continues as in your original example]"

Final Instruction: If the total analysis becomes too long and you must cut the response short, please end the output with the following clear message:
